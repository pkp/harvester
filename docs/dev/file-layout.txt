	===  OHS File Layout
	====================
	
The basic file layout is:

classes/ - the bulk of the PHP class files (objects, DAOs, etc.)
config.inc.php - configuration file, in PHP ini style
dbscripts/ - SQL/XML scripts for creating/updating the database
docs/ - misc. documentation
help/ - help files (XML)
includes/ - any PHP functional include files (not class files)
index.php - front controller
js/ - JavaScript files
lib/ - third-party libraries (currently Smarty and ADOdb)
locale/ - i18n files (XML)
pages/ - controllers for handling a subset of related requests
styles/ - CSS files
templates/ - Smarty templates
tools/ - any misc. shell scripts or tools not part of the main code base

The OHS code basically follows a rough MVC design -- at least as much as one can be forced onto PHP -- with "models" in the classes directory, "views" in the templates directory, and "controllers" in the pages directory.
