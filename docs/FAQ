===================================
Server Configuration and Management
===================================

   1) Will OHS work with PHP as a CGI instead of as an Apache module?

A: OHS is known to work reasonably well with PHP as a CGI using Apache's
   mod_actions. Since there are a number of different ways to configure Apache
   to use the CGI version of PHP (e.g., through FastCGI, etc.), your mileage may
   vary with other deployments (feedback is welcomed).

   OHS may not function correctly if the base OHS directory is located outside
   of the virtual host's DocumentRoot directory (e.g., when using mod_alias or
   mod_userdir). This is due to a bug/feature in the method PHP uses to
   determine the SCRIPT_NAME environment variable by stripping the DOCUMENT_ROOT
   from SCRIPT_FILENAME.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2) Will OHS work correctly in PHP's "safe mode"?

A: OHS is known to work reasonably well with PHP's safe mode restrictions
   (including open_basedir) enabled. Testing has not been extensive, so there
   may be unknown issues, in particular with very restrictive configurations
   that disable PHP functions relied on by OHS (feedback is welcomed).

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3) Will OHS work in a Microsoft IIS environment, or on other non-Apache web
      servers?

A: While OHS 2.x has not been tested on Microsoft IIS servers, it is based
   on the Open Journal Systems 2.x codebase, which has been tested on Microsoft
   Windows Server 2003 with IIS 6.0 on PHP 5.x. Additional standard environments
   should also be supported; we welcome feedback from users who have
   successfully installed and used Open Harvester Systems in other server
   environments.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   4) How can I create a backup of an OHS site?

A: It is strongly recommended that an OHS system be periodically backed up to
   guard against a failure in OHS or the server software or hardware that could
   result in data loss.
   
   To properly backup an OHS system, the following should be backed up:
     - The OHS database, using the tools provided by your DBMS (e.g.,
       mysqldump for MySQL, pg_dump for PostgreSQL)
     - The base OHS directory

       
   This backup procedure can be easily integrated into any automated backup
   mechanism.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   5) How can I move an existing OHS installation to a different server?

A: To move an OHS system from one server to another, you will need to:

   - Copy the database data, and import it into the new server (e.g., using the
     command-line tools provided by the DBMS)
   - Copy the base OHS directory and non-public files directory
   - Update config.inc.php with any changed settings for the new server
     (typically, the base URL, database authentication/access, email, and files
     settings will differ between servers)



=======================
Common Technical Issues
=======================

   1) When I try to access my OHS site this error message is displayed:
      "Warning: Smarty error: problem creating directory '/./templates' in
      ./lib/smarty/Smarty.class.php"

A: This can occur if a higher level directory has execute permission but not
   read permission. In these situations, the __FILE__ value in an included file
   appears to be relative to the location of the including file. This issue can
   be resolved by ensuring all parent directories are both readable and
   executable.

   See also this PHP bug report: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=16231>.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2) Uploads of large files fail inexplicably.
 
A: This can be caused by certain Apache or PHP settings.

   Apache 2.x has a LimitRequestBody directive that, if set to a low number, can
   lead to this behaviour. In particular, the default PHP packages for recent
   versions of Red Hat Linux set LimitRequestBody to 524288 bytes in
   /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf.

   Low values for the PHP ini settings like post_max_size (default "8M"),
   upload_max_filesize (default "8M"), and memory_limit (default "8M") can also
   cause this problem.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3) Emails sent out by the system are never received.

A: By default, OHS sends mail through PHP's built-in mail() facility.

   On Windows PHP needs to be configured to send email through a SMTP server
   (running either on the same machine or on another machine).
   
   On other platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X, PHP will sent mail using the
   local sendmail client, so a local MTA such as Sendmail or Postfix must be
   running and configured to allow outgoing mail.
   
   See <http://www.php.net/mail> for more details on configuring PHP's mail
   functionality.
   
   OHS can also be configured to use an SMTP server as specified in
   config.inc.php, either with or without authentication.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   4) I am using Apache 2.0.x, and OHS pages fail to load, producing an error
      like "File does not exist: .../index.php/index/...".

A: With some versions or configurations of Apache 2.0.x, it may be necessarily
   to explicitly enable the AcceptPathInfo directive in your Apache
   configuration file.
   
   See http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html for more information about
   this directive.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   5) OHS installation fails with the MySQL error "Client does not support
      authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL
      client".

A: This problem is caused by a change in the MySQL authentication protocol in
   MySQL, and can occur if your system is using an older MySQL client
   library with a newer MySQL server.

   See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Old_client.html for suggested
   approaches to resolve this issue.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   6) "Warning: ini_set(): A session is active. You cannot change the session
       module's ini settings at this time" messages appear when I load OHS.

A: Check if session.auto_start is enabled in your php.ini configuration. OHS
   requires this setting to be disabled, which is the default behavior in
   current versions of PHP.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   7) The installation form loads successfully, but after clicking the button
       to install, a blank page appears and the database was not created.

A: This may indicate that your server does not have the selected PHP database
   module installed and enabled (this can be verified by looking at the output
   of phpinfo() to see if the required database support exists -- see
   http://php.net/phpinfo).
   
   The OHS installer lists database drivers for which the required PHP
   extension does not appear to be loaded in brackets (e.g., "[MySQL]").
   
   Most Linux distributions offer a separate package that can be installed for
   each supported PHP database module -- e.g. php-mysql (for MySQL support), or
   php-pgsql (for PostgreSQL support).
   
   Note also that even with the module installed it may be necessary to modify
   your php.ini configuration to load the module, by adding "extension=mysql.so"
   or "extension=pgsql.so", for example.



==========================
Advanced OHS Configuration
==========================

   1) How can I control the address to which bounced emails will be sent?
      Why do messages sent with an envelope sender have an 'X-Warning' header?

A: To control the address to which a bounced emails will be sent, you need to
   set the envelope sender address. Enable the "allow_envelope_sender" option
   in the [email] section of the OHS 2.x configuration file; when this option
   is enabled, a "Bounce Address" field appears on Page 2 of the Journal Setup.

   Note that this option may require changes to the server's mail server
   configuration so that the user the web server runs as (e.g. "www-data") is
   trusted by the sendmail program, or an "X-Warning" header will be added to
   outgoing messages. Consult your mail server's documentation if outgoing mails
   include such a header.
   
   For example, Sendmail keeps a list of trusted users in the file
   "/etc/mail/trusted-users";  other mail systems use similar files.
   The command-line option used by OHS 2.x to set the envelope sender is "-f".

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2) I am changing the URL to my OHS installation. Does OHS need to be
      reconfigured to be accessible under the new URL?

A: The only reconfiguration that is required after a change in the site URL is
   to update the value of the "base_url" configuration setting in
   config.inc.php.
   
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3) How can I remove "index.php" from the URLs in OHS?

A: OHS uses a REST-style URL syntax for all of its links.  To force OHS to remove the
   "index.php" portion of all URLs, edit config.inc.php and set "restful_urls" to "On".
   
   In addition, your server will have to support URL rewriting in order to recognize
   the new URLs.  Apache servers use the mod_rewrite plugin, which must be enabled
   in your httpd.conf, and the following section added to the correct section of either
   your httpd.conf or an .htaccess file (preferred) in your OHS root directory (the same
   location as config.inc.php):
   
   <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
   RewriteEngine on
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [QSA,L]
  </IfModule>
